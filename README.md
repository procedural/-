Anyone knowns what math operator results in 44 different combinations of two 8's? The sum must not result in more than 8. Also, maybe it should equal to 45 if we include 00 possibility.

An alternative, two-sided spatial symmetric view of the same sequence:

This is some sort of balance operator, we have 8 things total and we split them between two spaces. 44 (or 45 with 00) is the count of all the possible splits between these two spaces.
